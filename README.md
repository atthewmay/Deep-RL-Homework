# Deep-RL-Homework

This project contains my homework for Berkeley's Deep Reinforcement Learning course (CS 294, fall 2018 offering).  

At this point, only homeworks 1 and 2 are (mostly) completed. Also included are some extra experiments/projects I am working on using code from the homework.

Homework 1: Imitation Learning (behavioral cloning and DAgger)
Homework 2: Policy Gradient & an attempt to teach my gravity-ball game to play itself.

Here are a few of the fun highlights:  

Homework 1: Imitation Learning

| Better dancer: Behavioral Cloning | Better runner: DAgger |

Homework 2: Policy Gradient

Discrete-action-environment cart pole task
| After 1500 training examples | After 25,000 training examples |
