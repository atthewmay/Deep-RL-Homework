# Deep-RL-Homework

This project contains my homework for Berkeley's Deep Reinforcement Learning course (CS 294, fall 2018 offering).  

At this point, only homeworks 1 and 2 are (mostly) completed, and only the README.md for homework 2 is uploaded. Also to be included are some extra experiments/projects I am working on using code from homework 2.

Homework 1: Imitation Learning (behavioral cloning and DAgger)  
Homework 2: Policy Gradient & an attempt to teach my gravity-ball game to play itself.

Here are a few of the fun highlights:  

## Homework 1: Imitation Learning

| Better dancer: Behavioral Cloning | Better runner: DAgger |

## Homework 2: Policy Gradient

#### Discrete-action-environment cart pole task

| After 1500 training examples | After 25,000 training examples |

Each time the cart-pole simulation with little training twitches it represents a crash.
